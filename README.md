expect-to
=========

expect-to is an assertion library based on pure functions. It works for both
Node.js and the browser, it can be used in any JavaScript testing framework and
it works in all new browsers.

[Why another assertion library?](#why-a-new-assertion-library)

Installation
------------

```
$ npm install --save-dev expect-to expect-to-core
```

Basic usage
-----------

```javascript
expect('test').to(equal('test'));
expect('test').to(not(equal('testing')));
expect(true).to(beTrue);
expect(true).to(not(beUndefined));
```

Or, within the Mocha BDD interface:

```javascript
import expect from 'expect-to';
import { not, equal, beTrue } from 'expect-to-core';

describe('my test', function() {

  it('should succeed when strings are equal', function() {
    expect('test').to(equal('test'));
  });

  it('with not, should succeed when strings are different', function() {
    expect('test').to(not(equal('testing')));
  });

  it('should be true', function() {
    expect(true).to(beTrue);
  });

});
```

Assertions available
--------------------

- [`expect-to-core`](https://github.com/kjbekkelund/expect-to-core) contains core assertions, such as `equal`, `beTrue`, `beEmpty` and `contains`.
- FIX: [`expect-to-promises`]() contains handling of promises, such as `beFulfilled` and `beRejected`.

Creating your own assertions
----------------------------

As an example of how to create an assertion, this is `equal`:

```javascript
function equal(expected) {
  return function({ actual, assert, stringify }) {
    return assert(actual === expected,
      `Expected ${stringify(actual)} to equal ${stringify(expected)}`,
      `Expected ${stringify(actual)} not to equal ${stringify(expected)}`);
  }
}
```

And this is how you use it:

```javascript
expect('test').to(equal('test'));
expect('test').to(not(equal('testing')));
```

You can also write the assertion using arrow functions:

```javascript
const equal = (expected) => ({ actual, assert, stringify }) =>
  assert(actual === expected,
    `Expected ${stringify(actual)} to equal ${stringify(expected)}`,
    `Expected ${stringify(actual)} not to equal ${stringify(expected)}`);
```

Why a new assertion library?
----------------------------

There are [many](http://chaijs.com/)
[assertion](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js)
[libraries](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js)
[out](https://github.com/power-assert-js/power-assert)
[there](https://github.com/moll/js-must), but I haven't found one that matches
what I want in an assertion library. These are _not_ complaints of the
existing libraries, they are different philosophies. What works for me is not
necessarily the right choice for you.

First, I want my assertions to feel like JavaScript and I therefore don't want
this style of chaining assertions:

```javascript
someVar.should.be.a('string');
should(null).not.be.ok();
should.not.exist(err);
expect(foo).to.be.a('string');
expect(obj).to.have.property('key')
  .with.length(3);
expect(window).not.to.be.an(Image);
```

An assertion library must also have great error messages, which excludes basic
asserts:

```javascript
assert('kim' == user.name);
assert('number' == typeof user.age);
```

(Yep, I know [Power Assert](https://github.com/power-assert-js/power-assert)
solves that problem.)

It must also be extremely simple to extend. I want assertions for React,
Sinon.js and others, but they shouldn't be built into the core itself â€” the
core should be framework agnostic. To me it's important that extensions
are first class members, not something that is tacked onto some prototype or
added to an instance. This exludes things like:

```javascript
beforeEach(function () {
  jasmine.addMatchers({
    toBeDivisibleByTwo: function () {
      return {
        compare: function (actual, expected) {
          return {
            pass: (actual % 2) === 0
          };
        }
      };
    }
  });
});
```

On that note, I also don't want to mix the test library with the assertion
library. This also ecxludes things like:

```javascript
test('equal test', function (t) {
    t.plan(1);
    t.equal('test', 'test');
});
```

It _must_ also end up calling a function, not assert on property access. What happens here?

```javascript
myVar.should.be.false;

// or maybe a test with a small typo
myVar.should.be.undefied;
```

The latter _doesn't_ fail no matter what `myVar` is because it
[_always_ returns `undefined`](https://github.com/moll/js-must#asserting-on-property-access).
And on that note, what about:

```javascript
undefined.should.not.be.ok;
```

This doesn't work as you cannot add properties to `undefined` and `null`.

`expect-to` is my attempt at building an assertion library that solves all of these problems.
